          <a Laws> </a>
            <h2>Laws</h2>
              <h3>The laws around hunting can be confusing and overwhelming, and lots of beginner hunters can find themselves in serious trouble if they are unfamiliar with their local laws. Thankfully there are plenty of reliable resources that have the laws organized in ways that make them easy to understand. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources' website is a great source for information about hunting laws, and it is the most up-to-date source available. Other reliable resources include hunter-ed.com, eregulations.com, or your local game and wildlife office.</h3>

            <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
              <h3>While the success of a hunting trip is largely based on chance, there are a few simple things that beginner hunters can do to improve their odds of getting a deer. The first and most obvious thing is to be prepared to sit and wait for a long time. That means dressing warm, bringing water and snacks, and mentally preparing yourself to sit alone in the woods for a few hours. The biggest mistake that beginner hunters make is that they leave the stand too early, and they end up missing out on the herd that was slowly making its way to them. Remember to be patient, and don't expect a trophy buck to walk out in front of you five minutes after you get set up. </h3>
              <h3>Another easy tip for beginner hunters is to focus your time in the stand on early morning and just before sunset. Deer are relatively dormant during the day, so the time just after sunrise and just before dusk can be prime hunting time because this is when deer are most active. Deer also typically travel in packs of 1 buck and 1 to 3 doe, so don't get dissappointed if you see a small doe that looks like she is traveling alone because there is more than likely a buck somewhere close.</h3>

            <h2>Other Resources</h2>
              <h3>There are tons of great videos and how-to guides on things like field dressing, skinning, processing, and cooking your animal. YouTube is a great source for a lot of this information, and websites such as americanhunter.org, fieldandstream.com, realtree.com all have great articles on all of the things that beginner hunters will need to learn. A good rule of thumb is to watch some videos and do some learning about how to do things like field dressing and processing an animal before you go hunting, that way you have some background knowledge and you are not trying to learn everything under pressure in the heat of the moment.</h3>
