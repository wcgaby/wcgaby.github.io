      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <h4>I was raised in Constantine, Michigan
and moved to Goshen for middle
school and high school. I grew up loving the outdoors,
and I enjoy hunting and fishing. I am a junior in the
business department at Goshen College pursuing a
marketing degree. I am passionate about solving
problems by using new perspectives to find unique
solutions, and I pride myself on my integrity, work
ethic, and flexibility. I enjoy working with people and
getting to know how they work best so that we can
work together to bring out the best in each other. I
function best when I have an active work
environment with clear goals and tasks set for myself,
so staying busy yet organized is when I thrive.</h4>

      <h7>In the summer of 2020, a friend and I started a small
business doing odds and ends jobs for people around
their homes as a way to earn income after our
internships had been cancelled due to COVID. I
worked with clients on evaluating their needs and
making a plan to solve them. This involved a lot of on-
the-fly learning about quoting jobs, managing and
working with clients, and figuring out how to do things
that neither of us had never done before.</h7>
